About

Libft is a 42 school project that aims to recreate some standard C library functions as well as additional utility functions that will be used in various other 42 school projects.

The project includes functions for working with strings, memory, lists, and more, making it a valuable and reusable library for future projects.

Getting Started

To get started with the Libft library, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/libft.git
